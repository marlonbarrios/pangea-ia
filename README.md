# Pangea_IA

**Plataforma de IA Decolonial - Decolonizing the Digital**

![Pangea_IA Interface](public/image01.png)

Imagine a world where artificial intelligence breaks free from its colonial constraints—where algorithms learn not just from Silicon Valley datasets, but from the vast wisdom of Indigenous communities, the resistance songs of the Global South, and the speculative dreams of decolonial futures. This is Pangea_IA, a living laboratory where technology meets social justice, where code becomes poetry, and where AI agents engage in profound conversations about power, memory, and possibility.

Named after the ancient supercontinent that once united all lands before they drifted apart, Pangea_IA serves as both metaphor and methodology for reimagining how we build and interact with intelligent systems. Just as Pangea represented a time before artificial borders divided the Earth, this platform envisions AI before colonial hierarchies determine whose knowledge counts and whose voices are heard.

Through real-time voice conversations with specialized AI agents, users can explore critical questions about technology, colonialism, and resistance. Whether analyzing images through a decolonial lens, debating the future of democracy with historical figures in latent space, or measuring the "temperature" of colonial influence in contemporary scenarios, Pangea_IA transforms abstract concepts into lived, conversational experiences.

This is not just another AI chatbot—it's an artistic research platform that treats artificial intelligence as a medium for critical inquiry, a space for collective memory, and a tool for imagining worlds where technology serves liberation rather than domination. Built with support for thirteen languages and designed for voices that have been systematically excluded from tech development, Pangea_IA represents a radical experiment in making AI more just, more inclusive, and more human.

## The Project

Pangea_IA emerges as a groundbreaking artistic research project that challenges the fundamental assumptions of how artificial intelligence is conceived, developed, and deployed. Created by interdisciplinary artists and researchers **Marlon Barrios Solano** and **María Luisa Angulo**, this initiative represents a multi-year investigation into the possibilities of decolonial AI—intelligence systems that actively resist colonial patterns of knowledge extraction and hierarchical thinking.

### Project Genesis and Vision

Born from the intersection of critical theory, artistic practice, and technological innovation, Pangea_IA treats the ancient supercontinent as both historical metaphor and speculative framework. Just as Pangea existed before continental drift created the geographical divisions we know today, this project imagines artificial intelligence before the epistemological divisions imposed by colonial thinking—before certain knowledge systems were deemed "primitive" while others were elevated as "advanced."

The project operates as a living laboratory where theoretical concepts become experiential realities. Through voice-based conversations with AI agents trained on decolonial frameworks, users don't just read about concepts like "colonialidad del ser" or "antropofagia zombi"—they engage with these ideas in real-time dialogue, making abstract theory accessible and personally meaningful.

### Research Methodology

Pangea_IA employs what the creators call "artes del conocimiento" (arts of knowledge)—artistic practices that transform research into living creative matter. This methodology refuses the colonial separation between "art" and "science," "creation" and "knowledge production." Instead, thinking, researching, and imagining become part of the same creative process, where artistic creation finds legitimacy as situated knowledge and epistemic resistance.

The project's technical infrastructure serves this philosophical framework. Rather than building yet another AI application optimized for efficiency or profit, Pangea_IA prioritizes dialogue, reflection, and the amplification of marginalized voices. The platform's multilingual support isn't just a feature—it's a political statement about whose languages matter in the development of intelligent systems.

### Collaborative and Residency-Based Development

Currently in active development during a collective residency at Theater Im Depot in Dortmund, Germany, as part of the Beyond Gravity Festival, Pangea_IA exemplifies collaborative artistic research. The project brings together international artists including Lenara Verle (Brazil/Germany), Oliver Walton (Australia/UK), Marcel Gbeffa (Benin/France), and Vera Rivas (Mexico), creating a truly transnational dialogue about the future of AI.

This residency model reflects the project's core belief that meaningful AI development requires diverse perspectives working in sustained collaboration, rather than the isolated genius model that dominates Silicon Valley. The resulting platform bears the marks of multiple cultural frameworks, languages, and ways of understanding intelligence itself.
